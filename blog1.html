      <p>So today I was at school with my friends and it was the best day ever. But the main question is: why was it the best? Well, let’s get straight into it.</p>
      <p>We had a school trip to a museum. The museum was about art. Some of the artworks were beautiful, but some of them were kinda boring. After that, we returned to school. The trip took about an hour.</p>
      <p>Finally, the main part: we didn’t have homework and we had a party! The party was about just a day where the teacher said, “Bring any kind of food and we will eat it.” It was like going to school, but in the classroom eating together. Everyone brought food so we could all enjoy it.</p>
      <p>And that’s why today was the best day. 🙂</p>
      <p>Thank you so much for reading this. Bye!:&gt;</p>
